"""Neural Network Model Implementation for FastVPINNs with Hard Constraints.

This module implements a custom neural network model designed specifically for
FastVPINNs methodology, incorporating hard constraint enforcement. It extends
TensorFlow's Keras Model class to provide efficient PDE residual computation
and gradient-based training.

The implementation supports:
    - Flexible neural network architecture definition
    - Hard constraint enforcement through constraint functions
    - Adaptive learning rate scheduling
    - Attention mechanisms (optional)
    - Efficient tensor operations for PDE residuals
    - Custom gradient computation and training loops

Key classes:
    - DenseModel_Hard: Main neural network model with hard constraints

Versions:
    - 27-Dec-2024 (Version 0.1): Initial Implementation
